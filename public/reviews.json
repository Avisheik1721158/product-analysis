Then Beth phoned to provide details of the delivery - which was quicker than I had expected.  The delivery driver turned up on time and was happy to offload the chairs for me.   Then Beth emailed to make sure everything was ok.  Excellent service and really pleasant people to deal with.  Oh - and EXCELLENT value for money too!",
